# Sudden loss

It was October 15, 2023, my mom's birthday. Mom was at work, my sister and i were preparing to make a birthday surprise to her, it was 16:00 in the afternoon, sitting by myself, watching a movie. Suddenly, a weird feeling, never felt that, panicking without a reason, for goodness'sake what is hapenning to me?, i was home alone, feeling overwhelmed from nowhere.

Suddenly, i heard the phone ringing, it was my dad calling, i answerd the phone…"hey son, you're mom at home? "with a shaking voice…"no, she's not, why you're asking? Is she okay?"…" why you're panicking son, i'm just checking on her because sh's not responding to her phone, when she comes home tell her to call me"…"okay dad, bye"….

Still feeling the unwanted feelings, suddenly i remembered my grandmother, Tamimount (an amazigh name). I don't know how the association with my unwanted feelings, dad's call and grandmother occurred, but it just happenned in my head, i rushed to my facebook page, went directly to my cousin's profile, who i hadn't talked to for aproximately a year, and called her trough messenger for no logical reason. she answerd immediatly, with a crying voice..i began to realise what was hapenning..."Adnane, Hanna Tamimount died"…i felt like my soul was leaving my body, like i'm watching myself out of my body, the depersonnalization kicked in.. 

The news hit me like a tidal wave. My mind raced, trying to process the information that my cousin had just shared. Tamimount, my beloved grandmother, had passed away. A flood of emotions surged through me, leaving me paralyzed for a moment.

Tamimount, with her warm smile and comforting presence, had always been a pillar of strength for our family. The connection between the strange feelings I had earlier and my dad's call now seemed significant. It was as if some inexplicable force had alerted me to this tragedy.

My cousin's voice cracked as she shared the details of my grandmother's passing. I struggled to find words, my throat tightened, and tears welled up in my eyes. The depersonalization I felt earlier intensified, as if I were caught in a surreal dream that I couldn't escape.

To be continued…
