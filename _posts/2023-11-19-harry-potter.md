growing up, very few pieces of literature caught my attention, and the ones that did, made sure to mark my personnality probably forever, and today I am here to talk about harry potter, not just about the fact that my instagram handle is @adnane_leviosa (no joke you can look it up) but also about the lessons I learned from Harry and his friends who greatly influenced my journey as a computer science student.

<h3>The Power of Friendship:</h3>
In Harry Potter, Harry, Ron, and Hermione are best friends who help each other through thick and thin. This taught me how important it is to work together, just like in computer science when teamwork is key for tackling tough projects.

<h3>Learning from Mistakes:</h3>
Harry faces many challenges and failures in his magical journey. Similarly, in computer science, I learned that making mistakes is okay. Fixing errors and learning from them is a big part of becoming better at coding.

<h3>Always Learning and Adapting:</h3>
In the wizarding world, characters constantly learn new spells and adapt to different situations. In computer science, you need to keep learning too because things are always changing. It's like always adding new tools to your toolkit.
 
<h3>Making Good Choices:</h3>
Harry often has to make tough choices based on what's right. In computer science, making good and ethical decisions is crucial, especially when writing code that affects people.

<h3>Practice Makes Perfect:</h3>
Becoming a good wizard in Harry Potter takes practice, and the same goes for coding. Practicing regularly is important for getting better at writing code and creating software.
