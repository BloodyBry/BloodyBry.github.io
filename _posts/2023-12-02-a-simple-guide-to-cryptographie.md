In our new digital world, keeping information safe is more important than ever. One way to achieve this is through the fascinating world of cryptography. Cryptography is essentially the art of secret writing. Let's dive into the basics in simple terms to understand how it works and why it's crucial for our online security.

<h4><b>What is Cryptography?</b></h4> 
Cryptography is like a secret language that only those with the right key can understand. Imagine you have a treasure chest, and you want to keep its contents safe. Cryptography is like putting a magical lock on that chest so that only people with the special key can open it.
There's Two Type of Cryptography:

1. <b>Symmetric Key Cryptography:</b>
	In this type, there's one key for both locking and unlocking the information. It's like having one key that both locks and unlocks your front door. The challenge is to keep that key secret from anyone who shouldn't have it.
2. <b>Asymmetric Key Cryptography:</b>
	Here, we have two keys: a public key and a private key. The public key is like a mailbox, anyone can use it to send you a secret message. However, only you, with your private key can unlock and read what's inside.

<h4><b>Why Cryptography Matters:</b></h4>

1. <b>Secure Communication:</b>
	When you send an email, shop online, or do anything on the internet, cryptography helps keep your information safe from curious eyes. It ensures that even if someone intercepts your message, they can't understand it without the right key.
2. <b>Protecting Passwords:</b>
	Ever wonder how your passwords are kept safe? Cryptography encrypts them, turning them into a secret code. This way, even if a website gets hacked, your password remains a mystery without the proper key.
3. <b>Digital Signatures:</b>
	Cryptography also makes sure that a message or file is really from the person or place it says it's from. It's like a digital signature confirming, "Yes, I sent this, and no one messed with it."
4. <b>Blockchain Technology:</b>
	Cryptography plays a crucial role in securing transactions in blockchain, the technology behind cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. It ensures that transactions are authentic and cannot be altered.

As someone intrested by the art of cryptography, I've deepened my understanding by completing an online certificate course in cryptography from Charles Sturt University. You can view my certificate on my linkedIn profil [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adnane-el-yazidi-5b5b75280/).

In conclusion, cryptography acts as the guardian of our secrets. Whether it's securing our messages, passwords... This magical art of secret writing keeps our online world a safer place. So, the next time you send a message or make an online purchase, remember that a little bit of cryptography is working behind the scenes to keep your information safe and sound.
